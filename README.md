## Project Description

This is a data science final project for the BIOS611 UNC Chapel Hill course. Contained in this repository are R scripts to perform data imports and analyses, an R markdown file to render a PDF report, and a Dockerfile and a Makefile for an easily reproducible pipeline. 

The exploratory analyses aim to describe different trends in Pokemon popularity and base stats. First, different prediction models were employed and evaluated on a range of features, using Spearman's correlation as a comparison metric to determine which model can best predict Pokemon popularity rankings. Then, principal component analysis was performed on base Pokemon stats (heath, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, & speed) in attempts to identify different competitive role clusters for designing team compositions. All data necessary for analyses are pulled and included in the workflow.
